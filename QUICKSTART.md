## üìã Common Commands

### Running the Application
```powershell
# Activate virtual environment first
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run SNATT
python src/main.py
```

### Running Tests
```powershell
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_device.py
```

### Checking Logs
```powershell
# View today's log file
Get-Content logs\snatt_*.log -Tail 50

# Follow log in real-time (while app is running)
Get-Content logs\snatt_*.log -Wait -Tail 10
```

## üéØ Quick Tips

### Discovery
- **Use CIDR notation** for full subnets: `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Use IP ranges** for partial ranges: `192.168.1.1-192.168.1.50`
- **Scanning speed**: ~254 IPs scanned in 10-30 seconds

### Diagnostics
- Always **connect devices first** before running diagnostics
- Start with **Interface Health Check** - it's the fastest
- **CPU & Memory Check** shows resource utilization
- Results are color-coded: üü¢ Green = OK, üü° Yellow = Warning, üî¥ Red = Critical

### Backups
- Backups are stored in `backups/` directory
- Files are named: `{hostname}_{type}_{timestamp}.cfg`
- Use **batch backup** to backup multiple devices at once
- Set up **scheduled backups** in Settings for automation

### Reports
- **Excel format** is best for detailed analysis
- **PDF format** is best for sharing with management
- Reports are saved in `reports/` directory
- Include **charts** for visual representation (enable in Settings)

## üîß Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Problem: Can't discover devices
```powershell
# Test if you can ping manually
ping 192.168.1.1

# Check if you're on the right network
ipconfig
```

### Problem: Can't connect to device
```powershell
# Test SSH manually
ssh username@192.168.1.1

# If that works, check your credentials in SNATT
```

### Problem: Application errors
```powershell
# Check logs for details
Get-Content logs\snatt_*.log -Tail 50

# Ensure all dependencies are installed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìö Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Read the full User Guide**: `docs/user_guide.md`
2. **Review the PRD**: `PRD.md` - Complete project specifications
3. **Customize workflows**: Edit `config/default_config.json`
4. **Explore advanced features**: API integrations, scheduled tasks, custom reports

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start small**: Test with 1-2 devices before scanning entire networks
2. **Save your inventory**: Export discovered devices to CSV for future reference
3. **Regular backups**: Schedule nightly backups for critical devices
4. **Monitor health**: Generate weekly health reports to track trends
5. **Use tags**: Organize devices with tags like "production", "lab", "critical"
